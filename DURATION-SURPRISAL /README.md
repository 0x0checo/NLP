# Replicating the Relationship Between Phonetic Clarity and Surprisal

## Description
This project aims to replicate the well-documented finding that phonetic clarity correlates with surprisal. Specifically, when speakers convey less information, their articulation tends to be less clear, while greater clarity is observed when more information is communicated. For a detailed theoretical background, refer to Jaeger and Buz (2017) and the cited references within.

## Data
The analysis is based on the following datasets:
- **Dataset Name 1**: [Brief description of the dataset, e.g., conversational speech corpus, controlled lab recordings, etc.]
- **Dataset Name 2**: [Another dataset, if applicable, with its purpose in the analysis.]
- Data were sourced from [source, e.g., publicly available databases, prior studies, etc.]. 
- Any preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, segmentation) are detailed in the relevant scripts.

## Usage
To replicate the findings:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/phonetic-clarity-surprisal.git
   cd phonetic-clarity-surprisal
